## **Sahaba Explorer Project**

*Sahaba Explorer* is a Java-based project that harmonizes Islamic knowledge with technology, meticulously organizing Sahaba data. This project represents a significant stride in merging Islamic records with advanced technology.

### **Project Highlights:**
- **Focus:** The project centers on the detailed organization of Sahaba data, highlighting critical details such as names, ages, conversion to Islam, familial ties, and more.
  
### **Motivation:**
- Motivated by the intersection of Islamic records and technology, *Sahaba Explorer* addresses the market gap, aiming to deepen appreciation for the contributions of Sahaba. Advanced data structures and algorithms are employed for efficient data management and accessibility.

### **Key Data Structures & Algorithms:**
- **Graphs:** Manage blood ties and connections between Sahaba.
  
- **Binary Search Trees:** Identify the eldest or first embracers among N Sahabas.
  
- **Hashing (DJB2):** Streamline data storage by hashing Sahaba names, utilizing linear probing to prevent collisions.
  
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest links between Sahabas via blood relations and other connections.
  
- **Queues & Priority Queues:** Manage Sahaba instances when finding Sahabas by partial names and in Dijkstra's algorithm.
  
- **Arrays & Array Lists:** Store and manage Sahaba instances.
  
- **Tree Traversal Algorithms:** Used for outputting data.

This project not only addresses the technological gap in Islamic records but also employs advanced algorithms for efficient Sahaba data management. *Sahaba Explorer* stands as a testament to the intersection of Islamic knowledge and cutting-edge technology.
